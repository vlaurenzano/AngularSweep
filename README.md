# AngularSweep

Angular Sweep is a Minesweeper clone using Angular.js.

I wrote it to teach myself Angular early 2014. Got it working and never looked back :)

## Features
Allows single and double click.
3 Difficulty levels

## Missing
Does not keep track of time
Pretty sure it builds the board before you click the first time, so it is possible to die the first time :)

##Instructions
You may need to run this on a local web host or it will cry about cross-origin requests when you open index directly from your file system.
